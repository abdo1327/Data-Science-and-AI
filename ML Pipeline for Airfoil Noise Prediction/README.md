# Airfoil Noise Prediction Pipeline

## Background
I'm a data engineer at an aerospace company tasked with creating an ML pipeline for airfoil noise prediction. Our focus is on designing efficient airfoils for planes and vehicles. This project uses a modified NASA dataset.

## Goals
1. **Data Prep**: Cleaned and stored the dataset
2. **ML Pipeline**: Developed a prediction pipeline
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance
4. **Model Storage**: Saved the model for future use

## Dataset
- Modified NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset

## Tools
- PySpark

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Processed and stored the data
2. **ML Pipeline Development**: Designed a prediction pipeline
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance
4. **Model Storage**: Saved the model for later use

This project was part of my IBM Data Engineering Professional Certification journey.
